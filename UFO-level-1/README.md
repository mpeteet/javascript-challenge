# Javascript Homework - Javascript and DOM Manipulation

## Background 

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.


## Project
My task was to write code using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js that will create a table dynamically based upon a provided dataset. Users are able to provide a date and get listing of sightings for that time period.
